            The main project in my third year design course was to redesign and
            digitize a non-Western instruemnt. Over the course of about 3
            months, in groups of 6, we started with the Google Design Sprint,
            then continued to rapid prototype and user test to reach the best
            design possible.

            The only requirement was that it had to be a non-Western / orchestra
            instrument. We did some research, and came up with a list of
            feasible instruments. We discussed and voted on our favourites, and
            narrowed it down to the following:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ol>
              <li>1. Bagpipes</li>
              <li>2. Cajon</li>
              <li>3. Rainstick</li>
              <li>4. Beatboxing</li>
              <li>5. Lute</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <FlexWrapper>
              <IntroImage src={Cajon} alt="cajon" />
              <span>
                The Cajon, a peruvian drum, was selected because of it's
                simplicity. It was realistic to build one in 3 months, and there
                was a lot of freedom in improving it. We then listed some
                problems we found the cajon:
                <br />
                <br />
                <ol>
                  <li>Posture Problems</li>
                  <li>Wrist Strain</li>
                  <li>Sound limitations - not a great solo instrument</li>
                  <li>Height limitations</li>
                </ol>
              </span>

            Develop an improved cajon that enhances the ergonomics of the
            playing experience with respect to posture and strain while
            increasing the portability and expressibility of the playing
            experience.

            This was probably my favourite design project I've done. User
            testing proved to be extremely useful, and going to the machine shop
            and building physical prototypes was definitely a change of pace for
            me. It was nice to get out of the software space and try something
            new.
            <br />
            <br />
            From a technical standpoint, the hardware design was not perfect as
            we had a very limited budget. We spent about $80 on materials
            throughout this entire process, thus we were unable to get perfect
            mappings on the cajon. Similarly, the controls were hard to reach,
            and were relatively low-fidelity (breadboard taped to the back of
            the caj贸n).
            <br />
            <br />
            All in all, this was a success. We were able to synthesize the sound
            of a caj贸n, and build a significantly more ergonomic solution. Click{" "}
